Input choices can be arguments starting at the second one, a file with a choice per line, or lines from a piped command.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B choose
allows an interactive choice on stderr among lines from stdin (or arguments) and returns the result on stdout.

            multiple lines            menu            one line
                           --->      choose      --->
             args / stdin      TTY input / stderr      stdout

It is nearly the same goal as the shell builtin
.B select
with fancy I/O more.

If there are many choices, the selected line is validated when the key ENTER is pressed.

The optional argument
.I default_choice
can preselect a line.
In cursor mode, it falls back to the first line if there is no matching default.
